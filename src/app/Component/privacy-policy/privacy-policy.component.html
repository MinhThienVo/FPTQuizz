      <h4>Updated: March 10, 2020</h4>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em;" class="row">
      <p>Respecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are
        our guiding privacy principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
        <li>We don’t keep your personal information longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.</li>
        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or
          protect our rights.</li>
        <li>We don’t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.</li>
        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search
          engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores and protects your personally
        identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this
        information. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information,
        including the option to use services without providing personal information.</p><br>
      <p>We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes
        this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome
        and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).</p><br>
      <h3>Protecting students and their personal information</h3><br>
      <p>Quizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections
        and we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and The General Data Protection
        Regulation (“GDPR”). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational
        Rights Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Quizizz offers a limited feature set and web site experience for young users of
        Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to
        create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own,
        Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard
        student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate
        personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.</p><br>
      <p>Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Behaviorally targeted advertising is not permitted on Quizizz.</li>
        <li>Students can join games without creating an account.</li>
        <li>Students who have not or cannot provide consent have a limited product experience.</li>
        <li>The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.</li>
        <li>Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <h3>Parental Rights</h3><br>
      <p>Quizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent (in the U.S., this
        means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation
        such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally
        identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz.
        Currently, the only personal information we collect from a child younger than 13 is their parent's or guardian’s
        email address.</p><br>
      <p>
        Parents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing
        their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child’s access to Quizizz. Parents
        may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information
        from their children by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@quizizz.com">privacy@quizizz.com</a>. Quizizz
        may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding
        to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from
        children.</p><br>
      <p>Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz.
        While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve
        their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
        younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our
        intention not to gather this information, that we collected personally identifiable information from a child
        younger than the age of consent without permission then we will either delete this information or seek to obtain
        verifiable parental consent from the child’s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the
        child with Quizizz services in the future.</p><br>
      <br>
      <h3>How Quizizz Collects Personal Information</h3><br>
      <p>The information that Quizizz collects depends on the nature of the services you request. For example, fewer
        data are collected from a student joining a game without an account than from a teacher who creates an account
        in order to create quizzes and host games. All interactions with the Quizizz website or app produce metadata
        that may identify you or could be identifiable information when paired with other information about you. In
        every case, Quizizz strives to collect only the minimum necessary information from you as is necessary or
        appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizizz or that is required by law.
        Visitors to the Quizizz website or app may always refuse to supply personally identifying information, however,
        doing so may prevent you from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><br>
      <h3>Information you provide to Quizizz</h3><br>
      <p>Accounts are not a prerequisite to using Quizizz, but are required to access some features and to save progress
        over time. If you create an account, Quizizz saves the account information you provide. This information may
        include: an email address, a parent or guardian email address, first name, last name, profile photo, or
        organization name. </p><br>
      <p>You may choose not to provide specific information or to delete or modify it at any time. These actions may
        prevent you from engaging with specific services or features that require this information. Additional
        information may be provided to Quizizz if you communicate with our support team, participate in user research,
        marketing campaigns or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the services. </p><br>
      <p>If you engage in a financial transaction with Quizizz, you may be asked to provide additional information such
        as a credit card number, billing address or full name.</p><br>
      <p>
        As you use the service, you may also create academic content including quizzes and certain forms of responses.
        This information is not typically personally identifying, but it may be deleted at any time either by the
        relevant account holder or by reaching out to our team at <a
          href="mailto:support@quizizz.com">support@quizizz.com</a>.</p><br>
      <h3>Information collected automatically</h3><br>
      <p>We receive and store some types of information automatically as you use the service. These may include device
        information such as device model, operating system, and device identifiers such as IDFA and UDID. </p><br>
      <p>Quizizz also collects log information as you use the service. These data may include information regarding how
        and when you use the service as well as your browser type, preferred language, time zone, referring site, and
        internet protocol (IP) address. </p><br>
      <p>We may use your IP address to generate a general approximation of your location to provide the service.
        Examples include providing the right version of Quizizz based on your state or country and helping teachers
        select their school when they sign up. Quizizz does not collect fine location data such as GPS or bluetooth
        beacons.</p><br>
      <h3>Information from other sources</h3><br>
      <p>Depending on how you use the service, Quizizz may collect information from partners and integrated
        technologies. For example, if you choose to use Google Login or join using the Google Classroom integration, we
        may receive information including your name and email address from Google. Quizizz does not have access to the
        passwords used to log into your Google accounts. </p><br>
      <p>We may also receive your personal information from another user. For example, a teacher might input your email
        in order to share a quiz or parent report. If a teacher chooses to enter student information directly into
        Quizizz or requires students to sign up via the Google Classroom Integration, Classes on Quizizz, or a similar
        rostering functionality, we require that teachers or schools get parental consent before using Quizizz with
        children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own.</p><br>
      <p>Content on Quizizz may contain links to other websites not affiliated with the service. We are not responsible
        for the privacy practices of other websites and users need to be aware of the data privacy practices of such
        sites should they choose to use these links.</p><br>
      <h3>Sensitive Information</h3><br>
      <p>As described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services. Quizizz does
        not knowingly collect data considered sensitive by GDPR such as those related to race or ethnicity, health and
        biometric information, or political affiliation. In addition to these categories, we do not collect free or
        reduced lunch eligibility. </p><br>
      <h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3><br>
      <p>
        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's
        browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to test new features and to help

          comply with GDPR. </li><br>

          request. In such cases, we will let you know in advance unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.</li>
