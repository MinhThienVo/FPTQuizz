      <p class="faq-a">The Quizizz website ("<b>Service</b>") is a hosted service operated by<b> Quizizz
          Inc.</b>(referred to as "<b>Quizizz</b>"). Any use of the Service is subject
        to the following Terms and Conditions of Use ("<b>Terms and Conditions</b>"), as well as to&nbsp;<a
          href="/privacy">Quizizz's Privacy Policy</a>, all of which are incorporated by reference into these Terms and
        Conditions. Your use of the Service will constitute your acceptance of these terms and
        conditions.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Eligibility: </b>Use of the Service is void where prohibited. The Service is for users of all ages. For
          children younger than 13, Quizizz offers a limited feature set and does not require Quizizz to obtain parental
          consent. We designed our system to permit children to use Quizizz without Quizizz collecting personally
          identifiable information other than persistent identifiers that recognize the Quizizz user as a repeat
          visitor. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) all registration information you submit is
          truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and, (c) your use of the
          Service does not violate any applicable law or regulation.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Your Quizizz Account and Data: </b> If you create an account on the Service, you are responsible for
          maintaining the security of your account and data, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur
          under the account. You must immediately notify Quizizz of any unauthorized uses of your data, your account or
          any other breaches of security. Quizizz will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any
          damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. Quizizz may from time to time set storage
          limits for your data, or take any other measures Quizizz considers appropriate to manage the Service. Quizizz
          may also from time to time change its policies on offering commercial content or displaying advertising, and
          it may do this without notice.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Prohibited Content and Activities, and Responsibility of Contributors: </b>If you create quizzes, comment
          via the discussion boxes, post material to the Service, post links on the Service, or otherwise make material
          available by means of the Service (any such material, "Content"), you are entirely responsible for the content
          of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question
          constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, computer software or any other format in which Quizizz stores data.
          You are also entirely responsible for ensuring that you are lawfully entitled to use any information and
          content. Quizizz does not assume any responsibility for damage caused by your acts, errors, omissions or
          negligence with respect to the content you post to Quizizz.<br><br></li>

        <li><b>Trademarks: </b>Quizizz, Quizizz.com, the Quizizz.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks,
          graphics and logos used in connection with Quizizz, or the Service are trademarks or registered trademarks of

          the Service may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Service grants you no right or
          license to reproduce or otherwise use any Quizizz or third-party trademarks.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Changes: </b>The Service, including without limitation all content there available and these Terms and
          Conditions, may be changed at the sole discretion of Quizizz and without notice. You are bound by any such
          updates or changes, including but not limited to those affecting these Terms and Conditions, and so should
          periodically review these Terms and Conditions.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Limitation of warranties of Quizizz, its suppliers and its licensors: </b>Except as otherwise expressly
          stated, all content posted to or available from the Service is provided "as is", and Quizizz, its suppliers
          and its licensors make no representations or warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to
          warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or non-infringement of proprietary
          rights. You understand and agree that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, the
          Service at your own discretion and risk, and that Quizizz, its suppliers and its licensors will have no
          liability or responsibility for any damage to your computer system or data that results from the download or
          use of such content or services. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some
          of the above may not apply to you.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Limitation of liability of Quizizz, its suppliers and its licensors:</b>Except as otherwise expressly
          stated, in no event will Quizizz, its suppliers or its licensors be liable to you or any other party for any
          direct, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, regardless of the basis or nature of the claim,
          resulting from any use of the Service, or the contents thereof or of any hyperlinked website including without
          limitation any lost profits, business interruption, loss of data or otherwise, even if Quizizz, its suppliers
          or its licensors were expressly advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will the aggregate
          liability for any and all of your claims against Quizizz, its suppliers and its licensors arising out of or
          related to use of the Service, or the contents thereof or of any hyperlinked website exceed the amounts
          actually paid by you to Quizizz during the 12-month period prior to the date a claim is made. Some
          jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain incidental or consequential
          damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. The parties agree that this Section 10
          represents a reasonable allocation of risk.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>General Representation and Warranty: </b>You represent and warrant that your use of the Service will be
          in accordance with Quizizz's Privacy Policy, with these Terms and Conditions, with any applicable laws and
          regulations, including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other
          governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws
          regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you
          reside, and with any other applicable policy or terms and conditions.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Miscellaneous: </b>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Quizizz and you
          concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an
          authorized executive of Quizizz, or by the posting by Quizizz of a revised version. Except to the extent
          applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, these Terms and Conditions, any access to or use of the Service
          will be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware, U.S.A. If any part of these Terms and Conditions is
          held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the
          remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of
          these Terms and Conditions or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition
          or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under these Terms and Conditions to any party
          that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms; Quizizz may assign its rights under these Terms and
          Conditions without condition. These Terms and Conditions will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of
          the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</li>
